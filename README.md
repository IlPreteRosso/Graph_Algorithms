# Graph_Package

Hello there, this package contains the Graph datastructure I found in the other day on someone else's github repo (sorry I really 
forgot which one) and graph algorithms I coded based on it. Feel free to use this packge and perhaps add new functionalities to
it.

My compiling environment is based on C++ 14, so if your local gcc setting is something older C++ standards that throws tons of 
warnings, try adding -std=c++14 to your compile command.
